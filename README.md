## Overview
This is the complete package to create a day scheduler for working hours. You can enter and save your data into specific time boxes, as well as see a visual representation of past, present, and future hours.

## Installation
This HTML file requires a .CSS style sheet and .js file for javascript functionality. By placing the entire website folder on a server together, it can be uploaded to a server, and the files can be found. Additionally, several stylesheets and scripts are, respectively, at the top and bottom of the index.html document to link to cdn and .min.js files elsewhere on the internet.

## Features
The current date is displayed at the top of the page. Click on the middle column to input a task, and hit the save button to the right, to save it. If you refresh your page, it will still be there. Hours in the past will have gray backgrounds, hours in the future will have green backgrounds, and the present hour will have a red background.
